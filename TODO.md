# TODO - DFE Developer Environment

## Completed This Session

- [x] Add `app-notifications = no-clipboard-copy` to Ghostty Linux config
  - Disables the copy notification popup
  - Syncs project config with actual machine config

## Immediate Tasks

- [ ] **Local host scripts for maclike/winlike swap**
  - Bash scripts in `tools/` or similar for quick mode switching
  - `switch-maclike.sh` — runs `ui-mode maclike` with DBUS auto-detection
  - `switch-winlike.sh` — runs `ui-mode winlike` with DBUS auto-detection
  - Handle case where GNOME is not running (save preference for next login)
  - Could also be a single script: `desktop-mode [winlike|maclike]`
